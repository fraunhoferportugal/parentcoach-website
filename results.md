* November 2023, the team led the [African Co-Design Academy Summer School](https://parentcoach.projects.fraunhofer.pt/african-co-design-academy/). During two days, participants had the opportunity to explore co-design approaches and best practices, with a particular emphasis on the African context. We gathered lecturers from different African countries and with diverse experiences in engaging in these methods. Attended by 11 African students. <br/><br/>
