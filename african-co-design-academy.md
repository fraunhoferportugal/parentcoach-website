The African Co-design Academy is a two-day summer school focused on exploring co-design approaches and best practices, with a particular emphasis on the African context. The academy aims to enhance participants' knowledge of co-design, share exemplary approaches to co-design in Africa, foster networking opportunities, establish connections between African [SIGCHI chapters](https://sigchi.org/chapters/), and encourage collaboration among African researchers and students in HCI and related disciplines.

The event will take place on November 26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> 2023, in East London, South Africa, co-located with [AfriCHI 2023](https://africhi2023.org/). We will accommodate approximately 18 participants.<br/><br/>

## Objectives

- Familiarise participants with co-design methods, with examples from work conducted in the African context;
- Briefly experiment with co-design approaches, through hands-on exercises and projects;
- Promote discussion and knowledge exchange among participants and between African SIGCHI chapters.<br/><br/>


## Contents and organisation

During the first day, participants will be introduced to community-based co-design, communication and collaboration in co-design, and co-design readiness. We will also present tools and techniques to engage participants, including speculative design, games as co-design tools, design cards, or other traditional community-based approaches. Participants will be able to experiment with these techniques in a small group project focused on creating a communication/collaboration tool for African HCI researchers. 

During the second day, participants will continue working in small groups in their project. In parallel, we will encourage reflection on ethical issues, sharing with participants some obstacles that have appeared in the field, and inviting them to think about how to develop or build trust with the communities to then ensure the sustainability of collaborations with community partners.<br/><br/>
